I entered the lunchroom, the familiar din of clanging trays and overlapping conversations greeting me like it always did. Balancing my tray with a juice box and sandwich, I let my eyes casually scan the room. My table was right where it always was, surrounded by my usual friends, who were already deep in a lively debate about some YouTube video we’d all watched.

I started walking toward them, but something made me stop. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed August standing near the edge of the room, clutching his lunch bag so tightly I thought it might rip. He wasn’t moving, just staring out at the crowded tables like he was facing a battlefield. My friends waved me over, but I hesitated. I saw August’s eyes darting around the room, searching for something—or someone—but finding nothing. His shoulders slumped just slightly, but it was enough for me to notice.

I remembered my first time walking into this lunchroom. I hadn’t known where to sit either. It was just after my dad died, and I’d transferred schools. Nobody had pointed or whispered, but I’d felt the weight of their stares. I’d felt like an alien dropped into a world that didn’t belong to me. That’s why, when I saw August standing there, looking like a lost balloon caught in a corner, I couldn’t just walk away.

The laughter from my friends floated toward me, but I knew they wouldn’t really understand—not the way I did. It didn’t matter, though. Taking a deep breath, I turned and walked toward August instead. The closer I got, the more I could see the tension in his face. His eyes flicked toward me, then quickly back to the floor.

“Hey,” I said, setting my tray down across from him. He looked up at me, startled. For a second, I thought he might tell me to go away. His face tightened, like he was bracing himself for some kind of insult. I kept my voice light. “Mind if I sit here?”

His eyebrows shot up. “You want to sit here?” he asked, his voice so quiet it was almost drowned out by the lunchroom noise.

“Yeah, why not?” I smiled and pulled out the chair. I could feel the eyes of my friends on my back, but I ignored them. “It’s better than sitting by myself, don’t you think?” I added, even though we both knew that wasn’t true.

For a moment, he didn’t respond. Then, slowly, he nodded. “Sure,” he mumbled, his voice tinged with hesitation. But he didn’t tell me to leave, and that was enough.

I started unwrapping my sandwich, talking casually about how the school lunch spaghetti looked suspiciously orange today and how the juice boxes were probably just flavored water. At first, August didn’t say much. He kept glancing at me like he was trying to figure out why I was there. But little by little, I saw him start to relax. His grip on the lunch bag loosened, and he even laughed softly when I joked about how the spaghetti might actually be lasagna in disguise.

I didn’t care that my friends would probably ask me about this later. I didn’t care that some kids might be whispering behind my back. What mattered was the look on August’s face—a look that said, for the first time that day, he didn’t feel invisible.

As we chatted about our favorite movies and how science class always smelled like vinegar, I realized something else: maybe August needed me to sit here today, but I needed it, too.
