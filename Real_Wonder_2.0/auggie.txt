As I stepped into the lunchroom, the sound hit me first—a roaring cacophony of clanging trays, overlapping conversations, and laughter that seemed to echo off the walls. My heart started pounding, the way it always did when I entered a crowded space. It wasn’t just the noise; it was the stares. Even though I tried to avoid looking directly at anyone, I could feel their eyes on me, flickering glances they thought I wouldn’t notice.

I gripped my lunch bag so tightly that my knuckles turned white, holding onto it like it was a lifeline. The air felt thick, heavy with tension, as I scanned the room. Groups of kids were clustered at tables, their voices blending into a buzz that felt like static in my ears. My eyes darted from one table to another, hoping to find a place where I wouldn’t feel completely out of place, but all I saw were backs turned toward me or glances that quickly looked away.

The lunchroom seemed impossibly big, but at the same time, it felt like there wasn’t enough space for me. I thought about going back to the classroom to eat by myself, but then I remembered Mr. Tushman’s voice in my head: “You can’t always hide, August. Sometimes, you have to put yourself out there.” Easier said than done, I thought bitterly.

As I stood frozen, the noises around me seemed to grow louder. Laughter erupted from a table nearby, and my face burned, certain they were laughing at me. I looked down at my sneakers, willing myself to disappear. But I couldn’t just stand there forever. Taking a shaky breath, I forced myself to move. My legs felt like lead as I walked, scanning for a table where I could sit without feeling like I was on display.

There was an empty table near the corner, but the thought of sitting there alone, with everyone staring at me, made my stomach churn. I thought about Jack and whether I should try sitting with him, but he was surrounded by other kids, all laughing and talking loudly. I knew I wouldn’t fit in there. I wasn’t sure I fit in anywhere.

Finally, I spotted a table near the edge of the room with only one other person sitting at it. It was Summer. She was busy unwrapping her sandwich, not talking to anyone, just... sitting. She didn’t look up as I approached, and for a moment, I hesitated. What if she didn’t want me to sit there? What if she said something like, “Sorry, this seat is taken,” or worse, didn’t say anything at all and just looked at me with pity?

But then she looked up, and our eyes met. She smiled. Not a big, fake smile like some of the teachers gave me, but a small, warm smile that made my heart stop pounding so much.

“Hey,” she said, her voice light and casual. “Want to sit here?”

I blinked, unsure if I’d heard her right. I looked over my shoulder, expecting to see someone else she was talking to, but there was no one there. Slowly, I nodded. “Sure,” I mumbled, my voice barely audible.

As I sat down, I felt the weight of the stares lift just a little. They were still there—I could feel them—but somehow they didn’t seem as heavy with Summer sitting across from me. She started talking about how weird the spaghetti looked today, and even though I wasn’t sure what to say, I felt my lips twitch into the smallest of smiles.

For the first time in what felt like forever, I didn’t feel completely invisible.
